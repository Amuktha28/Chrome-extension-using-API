# Chrome-extension-using-API
The chrome extension using API learnt from freecodecamp
I used Javascript,HTML,CSS to creat chrome extension in which i used API for getting informations about deaths in covid19
we need a javascript file for adding functions in the main page that needs to popup and a manifest.json that needs to to be used in chrome extensions we use manifest3 here
i took a html file to get a website that pops when we press the extension icon
